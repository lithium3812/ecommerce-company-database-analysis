# Data Analytics on E-commerce Company Database
This is a repository for MySQL query scripts that I wrote for advanced SQL for data analytics and business intelligence course by Maven Analytics. This is an entirely project-based course and it proceeded as if I was a data analyst in a virtual E-commerce company and I worked for possible requests from managers one by one.

## Database
MySQL database of a virtual E-commerce company. It is created by Maven Analytics and can be obtained only by purchasing their advanced SQL for data analyst course.
